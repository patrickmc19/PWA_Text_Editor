# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This is a simple text editor that can be used as a PWA (Progressive Web App). It is built using webpack, concurrently, nodemon, express, and react. The editor is a single page application that uses a textarea element to allow the user to enter text. The text is saved to a file on the server when the user clicks the save button. The user can also load the text from the file by clicking the load button. The editor is responsive and will work on mobile devices. The editor can be installed as a PWA on mobile devices and desktops. The editor can be used offline once it is installed as a PWA.

## Installation

To install the editor as a PWA, open the editor in a browser and click the install button in the address bar. The editor can also be installed as a PWA by clicking the install button on the editor's home page.

## Usage

To use the editor, open the editor in a browser and enter text in the textarea element. Click the save button to save the text to a file on the server. Click the load button to load the text from the file on the server. The editor can be used offline once it is installed as a PWA.
